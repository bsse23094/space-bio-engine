# Frontend (Angular) - Space Biology Knowledge Engine

This folder contains a minimal Angular scaffold to get started. It is intentionally lightweight so you can install dependencies locally and continue development.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
# From repo root
cd "c:\Users\BK\Documents\GitHub\Space-Biology-Knowledge-Engine\Frontend"
npm install
npm run start
```

Notes:
- The `package.json` includes Angular CLI as a dev dependency and simple scripts to run.
- The app expects the backend API at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`. You can change that in `src/environments/environment.ts`.

If you want, I can scaffold more feature modules and components next (articles list, dashboard, etc.).
