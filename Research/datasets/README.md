# Space Biology Knowledge Engine - Datasets Directory

This directory contains the datasets used in the Space Biology Knowledge Engine project.

## Files:

- `SB_publication_PMC.csv` - Original dataset from PMC (PubMed Central)
- `SB_publication_PMC_cleaned.csv` - Cleaned dataset after data exploration
- `SB_publication_PMC_processed.csv` - Processed dataset after text preprocessing
- `vocabulary.csv` - Vocabulary extracted from the corpus
- `tfidf_matrix.pkl` - TF-IDF matrix for topic modeling
- `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` - TF-IDF vectorizer object
- `embeddings.json` - Text embeddings for similarity search

## Usage:

These files are generated by running the Jupyter notebooks in the Research directory in sequence:

1. `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Creates cleaned dataset
2. `02_text_preprocessing.ipynb` - Creates processed dataset and TF-IDF matrix
3. `03_topic_modeling.ipynb` - Creates topic models
4. `04_embeddings.ipynb` - Creates embeddings
5. `05_similarity_search.ipynb` - Creates FAISS index
6. `06_visualizations.ipynb` - Creates visualizations
